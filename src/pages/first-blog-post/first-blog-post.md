## How was your day?

## 8:06 PM

It feels ridiculous to complain about our trivial first-world problems after knowing the hardship that our forefathers have to experience.

## 10:41 PM

I love the disciplined life that I am leading now. Timeboxing really works. 8 - 10 pm is moonwalking time.

## 12:09 AM

Human desire is a truly frightening thing. Even after seeing the same thing for the thousand times, I am still getting turned on by it.

The feedback loop for this DIY habit has been completed. I need to work doubly hard to *switch* it to another habit. Guitar? Meditate?

Here's a promise to my future self. I will ONLY DIY when I am dreaming. Apart from that, no DIY physically. I am kind of guy that won't DIY. I will no longer touch my own manhood. There are better things to do.

Although the me session earlier was fun, but I am truly running out of time. There's so so much things to learn. There's so much interesting thing in this world that I am interested it. This DIY is my vulnerability and limitation. I am thankful for the things it taught me: Discovering my likes and dislikes. But this has gotta stop. It's time I channel my sexual energy to other things. Sexual transmutation.

## What did you discover today?

1. Poon Kee's wanton noodle
   - Wonderful wanton noodle
     - QQ noodles + tasty char siew + awesome dumplings
   - Really filling as well. For a reasonable price
2. [CNA Hawkers in our Centre](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/video-on-demand/hawkers-in-our-centre)
   - This really brings the level of suffering to the next level.
   - The story about the uncle that goes barefoot to save money is heart wrenching. The level of hardship that they have is **unbelievable**. I almost feel ashamed of myself for complaining about our trivial issues. Our first world problem is absolutely pathetic compared to their real sufferings.
3. Dislike people who are arrogant or standoffish
   - The guitarist that made the video "make your playing interesting" is too arrogant. I don't like that kind of attitude. I align more with teachers who are humble and talented.
