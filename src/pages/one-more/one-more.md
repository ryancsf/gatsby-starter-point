## How was your day?

I had a good sleep yesterday.

What is my definition of good sleep?

1. At least 8 hours of sleep
2. At least one dream

By this definition, I had a good sleep.

Yesterday was an unproductive day. Going to the office on a non-Friday made me realise how much I cherish working from home. Especially yesterday when we had a long day at work without much productivity.

I couldn't even go for tennis. I was utterly tired. I didn't get enough sleep yesterday. Because I had trouble sleeping. Must be the coffee. I will cut back on coffee and supplements. Especially creatine. I know it's good for the workout but taking it daily is just troublesome. Same with omega 3 fish oil and  magnesium supplements. I am not a big fan of them because they up both physical and mental space.

## Action Items

- [ ] Cut back on coffee
- [ ] Finish supplements and don't buy them anymore
- [ ] Start the day with journal and meditation

## What are you thinking about?

> If you know that something is only going to entertain you temporarily, that you will get bored eventually, it's a distraction.

### Keep it simple / Stick to the basics

The KISS principle from programming world would apply well in life too. Stick to the basics:

1. Drink plenty of water
2. Meditate
3. Stretch
4. Exercise
5. Walk
6. Read
7. Be grateful
8. Think positively
9. Journal/Write

All of the above costs little to nothing and would greatly benefit our life. Yet, not many people would do it on a regular basis, myself included.

We don't need fancy supplements, coffee and other drugs. We are born with all we need.

### Productivity Schedule

I am most productive when I am in charge of my own schedule. For example, on the weekend, when I know I mostly have the whole day to myself, I can do so much more. Free from meetings, reportings and adhering to other people's schedule, I could do so *much more*. Because of that, it's important for me to prepare myself, both physically and mentally to join CRE.

It is a crucial step that I need to do. I need to devote myself more and more to CRE. There's a wealth of opportunities there to learn automation and apply myself.

### Benefits of Journaling

I am slowly beginning to realise the benefits of journaling. It's crazy how much data I have about myself just by doing consistent journaling day after day. It allows me to objectively identify my likes and dislikes, when I am most productive and the environment needed for me to excel. This is amazing. I need to keep this habit.
